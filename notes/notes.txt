Convolutional NNs 

What is a filter? 
Filter is a set of multipliers that transform a pixel and its neighbours.

Pooling
Pooling is a reduction in size of the image.
Usually done after filtering the image.
For example - maxpooling 2x2 - devides the image into 2x2 squares, and then picks the largest value from among them to represent the entire square.
This reduces the image size to 1/4 (half vertically, half horizontally).
